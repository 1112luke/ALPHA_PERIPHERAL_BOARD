## Introduction

This board was developed for NDXP's Alpha engine. Its purpose is to serve as a peripheral board to the [F.E.R.B.](https://github.com/1112luke/NDXPCOMPUTER) flight computer, and will facilitate data collection for the secifics of the Alpha mission. The board is responsible for collecting pressure and temperature data on the engine, as well as accelerometer data and load cell data during ground testing.

## Specifications

The board has capability in data collection, communication, actuation, and failsafe:

### Data Collection
- 12x 0-5v ADC (used for pressure sensing)
- 4x Thermocouple Channels
- 1x I2C accelerometer interface
- 1x Load Cell Interface

### Communication
- 1x RS-485 Channel (for communication with  [F.E.R.B.](https://github.com/1112luke/NDXPCOMPUTER))
- 1x Serial USB Port

### Actuation
- 4x Solenoid Valve Channels
- 1x Pyro Channel

### Failsafe
- 2x Keyed Switches (Pyro, Solenoids)
- 1x Burnwire Ignition Detection
- 1x E-STOP
